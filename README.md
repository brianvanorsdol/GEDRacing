# Objective: 
Provide a robust, highly modular grassroots-level Motorsport Development Board (MDB) along with a series of scalable peripherals

# Goals:
* Accuracy - Sensor readings can be trusted with as little noise as possible
* Reliability - alarms and triggers should initiate when needed
* Cost Effective - 
* Modular - 
* Familiar - Those with experience working with Arduino, ESP32, or other microcontrollers should feel familiar and be able to quickly get up to speed

# Key Features:
* ENTER SoC HERE****
  * ENTER CLOCK SPEED HERE****
* ENTER # OF GPIO HERE***
  * ENTER ANALOG PINS HERE***
  * ENTER DIGITAL PINS HERE***
* Onboard Bluetooth Classic/BLE and Wifi\
* Programmable notification LED
* USB-C
* Two CANbus tranceivers to create an isolated CANbus from the vehicle and facilitate lightweight and familiar communication to a variety of peripherals
* External power/data distribution node 
* Rugged waterproof Deutsch enclosure
* Deutsch DTM connectors

# Nice to Haves:
* Default Read-only mode - The MDB will always be set to a "read-only" mode for the CANbus connection to the vehicle to prevent accidental writing to the vehicle CANbus
* Data/CANbus backbone - A harness that originates at the external power/data distribution node and carries both the isolated CANbus (CAN H / CAN L) wires as well as 5v power
* External USB-C flashing - A USB cable that terminates at the main connector(s) to the MDB's enclosure and allows for flashing the MDB without removing it from its mounting position
* Hella sick wiring
* Transparent enclosure
